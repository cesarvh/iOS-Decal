//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

//    There's no need to have the ?s on the LHS of the assignment. The type has already been determined in the declaration of the variables

    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?

//    This was happening because we were declaring i as a constant... We can't really mutate constants, can we? ;) 
    // Also, we're supposed to return true!
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
// We need to change var lenA, lenB to a constant because it never is mutated.
// We also need to change the function to be static in order to be able to run the piece of code!
// We also need to return truee!

//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
